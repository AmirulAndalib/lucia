# Contributing guide

Lucia is a community-informed project instead of a community-driven project. While we are still open to contributions, the overall direction, scope, and goals are ultimately still up to the maintainers. As such, please open a new issue instead of creating a PR for anything larger than a simple bug report. Your PR will likely be rejected if not. Lucia is intended to be limited in scope and simple.
